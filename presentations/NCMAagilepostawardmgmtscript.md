## Some terms we’ll be using
Agile is a set of principles for building software.  It prioritizes people and their needs over everything else, so everything else is in service to people’s actual needs.  The most important thing is to deliver a steady stream of value.
To that end, it usually involves short cycles of work called sprints that are typically 2 weeks long.  You may hear us use the word iteration - for this talk, that’s the same as a sprint.
Agile practices often use a definition of done for each new feature, which is an easy-to-understand sentence or two that describes how to know that the feature is finished.  The software users, the government team that owns the software, and the development team building it generally all help write the definition of done.
There is also typically a product owner in an agile project - that’s the individual person who is empowered to make decisions and set the direction of the software development effort.
Features and work to be done are put into a prioritized list called a backlog.


## Round-robin time
[explain what we’re going to be doing]
Greg: How is post-award management defined?

	Michelle:  Post award management is define as working together with a vendor on completion of the services purchased. Post award management is critical to success of a program. Without proper contract administration we could be setting vendors and or the government up for failure. 

Rebecca:  How does TTS approach post-award management?
Team size and makeup
Working alongside the vendor during sprint ceremonies
Open communication
Video calls and slack
Rebecca: How do you allow the agile methodology principles to shape your post-award management?

Greg: The first thing is putting users first. Make sure users are at the kickoff workshop, and then make sure there’s regular user research to keep the product on target.  By regularly reprioritizing the backlog, we’re letting the most pressing user needs get worked on first.  If we had figured out up front exactly what we expected the vendor to do, we’d miss that target pretty quickly as the backlog changed.  Instead of measuring the vendor’s performance against a set of milestones or outputs that we defined in the beginning, we measure against the backlog.

We give our vendors leeway to choose how they want the team to work and ideally, they have an agile coach that can point them in the right direction if necessary. Occasionally, we will act as the agile coach and offer suggestions of how things can be going better. 


	Michelle: Have the flexibility within the project team and contracting office to understand that in a short time period not everything will get done. This is done by allowing for a Statement of Objectives and using LH contracts when possible. Additionally, during the evaluation process we seek vendors who practice agile methods. This is demonstrated by asking for working prototypes vs the vendor telling us what they have completed in the past. 

Michelle: Your projects require a product owner.  What is a product owner and what is required of them in the process, and in particular for post-award management?

	Rebecca: 
Define product owner. 
Peer amongst the development team. Empowered to make decisions on behalf of the program and to escalate potential problems that they team is having. 
Product Backlog management includes:
Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;
Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.
How to differentiate between a PO and a PM/program director? 
Depending on availability/capacity and product knowledge, a program director may be more of a stakeholder in our model. Because PO’s need to dedicate at least 50% of their time to this project, many program director’s (especially in government) can’t set aside the time for that. Sometimes they need to prioritize this over the other demands, sometimes it can be delegated to someone who better understands the customer base, policy concerns, etc
Greg: What are the top three things you require your product owner or COR/PM to understand for a successful post-award?

	Rebecca: 
PO time - prioritize this requirement, and authority to make the decisions, genuinely take ownership. Govt PO needs to be empowered to make decisions on the fly
PO can decide what is needed and not groom the backlog, and giving up the control to the dev team to determine the next backlog  - trust  in the vendor 
Empowerment is crucial for a successful PO and therefore a successful PAM.
Being able to decide whether or not a stakeholder suggestion should be disregarded because its not driven by user research

	Michelle: 
If the COR is not the technical expert its important they trust and understand the requirements being purchased so they can accept the work provided from the vendor 
If the delegation of authority is provided for acceptance, understanding that the backlog represents a wish list of work and at the end of a POP the contractor might not get to everything 
For reference we have a project within our group where the COR is very hands off and allows the technical poc and SME review and accept the work on a biweekly basis. The COR conducts the official acceptance in accordance with our QASP
Rebecca: How involved should subject-matter experts be in post-award?

	

Greg: Getting the agency IT and CIO shop involved is important.  CIO needs to be involved early because they have deep understanding of the information policies and requirements and can make sure the project stays within those bounds at a high-level.  Then the IT folks, whether they are part of the CIO’s office or they’re a separate office that more directly serves the program office, but the people who do the day-to-day IT work, they need to be involved in the daily project work as well.  They’re the ones who implement the policies from CIO, so we need to make sure they know where we’re headed so they can prepare, but also so they can push back on things that won’t fit with policy.  We want them integrated throughout, so as we work, the current state of the project is within the IT requirements, rather than trying to shoehorn the product into IT requirements at the end.

With DOL, we didn’t get the CIO and IT folks involved at the beginning and it caused us some problems.  For one, when we got to the end of the period of performance, IT wasn’t ready to accept the application into their environment, so it took some extra time and effort to get that setup.  Since they hadn’t been involved all along, we had to basically go back through a few weeks worth of discussion to find all the information they needed.  So, we’re about to start a second phase with them on the same product, and this time, we have IT heavily involved right from the beginning.  We’re already seeing that pay off because they are pointing out where the product doesn’t conform to standards, and because we’re not up against an immediate deadline, we’re able to discuss and even be flexible with their policies in a lot of cases, because we have time to go back and talk to CIO or whoever about it.

Michelle: ...answer notes here…

Depends on the expertise the SME has 
Identify smes that understand the work and know the stakeholders within the organization and who 
In order to be most productive, we need to limit the amount of folks in the room so we can get to the heart of what we need in terms of an MVP and start building. Because we ask for feedback throughout the different iterations, folks shouldn’t feel as though they are left out of the decision making process. A crucial point to this is realizing that we build products that are user centered and are not stakeholder driven. 
Product lead and Product owner make decision on who should be involved when 
Because the product owner is empowered by their agency executives, they can decide who should be in what meetings and who the team should be soliciting feedback from. 
FS PO has been on standups, the PO is very empowered and has the technical background to help navigate FS CIO vs DOL PO who understood the requirements but not very technical  
FS is also using cloud.gov for a set amount of time and large term want to set up their own type of cloud hosting solution 
FS CIO office is open to doing thing different within the space that they are provided 
DOL CIO high level people are more open to innovating on the issues but the actual people working on the projects have not heard or understand the direction CIO wants to go 
CIO have attend sprint planning if they are required to address any user stories or features 
Eqip- concerned about moving this off to cloud.gov into their hosting environment. Will be highly dependent on DOD CIO. 

Michelle: This style seems to add a lot of overhead to the project.  Why is that valuable or necessary?

	Rebecca: We haven’t experimented with a lighter touch. Haven’t tested minimally viable oversight.
Creating an environment that works to create trust. 
For PMO contracts, what’s the difference between contracts that provides folks that are in the office on a daily basis, that you need to manage? That creates an incredible amount of overhead. 
Very project oriented instead of professional services/staff aug. 

Greg: I would argue it’s not more overhead, but it’s shifting a lot of activities around in the project timeline.  Instead of front-loading it, it happens closer to when the actual work is done.  You’re only focusing on the things you’re actually about to do.

Greg: At the end of the period of performance, how can you know if the vendor is successful if there are still items in the backlog?

Rebecca: 
Clear that the backlog from the beginning was a wish list and having the client realize this from the beginning helped the vendor be successful, the PO has to be ruthless in the decisions on what is priority. 

Greg: The backlog should never really empty, because software is never really “finished.”  It can always be improved.  So success isn’t about doing everything in the backlog, but it’s about getting value at the end of each sprint, it’s about getting high-quality code that future vendors can continue to improve, and it’s about the vendor delivering a reasonable amount of value.  That’s kind of subjective, but that lets us keep in mind roadblocks we hadn’t planned for.

	Michelle: 
Cross functional team - need the technical skills to determine if the work provided 
This also helps build trust with the vendor.
Having a well understood and agreed upon definition of done for a single feature component (not the entire product). The technical lead assures that the story size they are saying is adequate and their completion of the story is adequate. 
The more explicit you can be up front is the best way. 
Example: If we had been more explicit about documentation and tests at the beginning of the POP, the vendor wouldn’t need to play catch up and can be more agile. 
Example: Testing was slacking with a vendor. The COR explained why this was unacceptable via the QASP. We discussed this during retro, the vendor changed their number of stories for the sprint so they could fix tests. 
Contractually if the program office builds in options for the requirement they could exercise the option to further the module along or complete items within the backlog 
Real example is equip and dol needing an option 

Michelle: How do you ensure that the vendors are delivering high-quality work?

	Rebecca: 
Open communication is the key to success here. We have technical leads that are reviewing the code being written, designers that are looking that mock ups, product leads that are ensuring that what is being built is in line with the product vision. Having these roles (applicable to your project) are key. We work side by side with our vendors, have daily standups, and are communicating throughout the day. If the vendor has something that is blocking them, they escalate it so they can focus on the work to be done and not get bogged down in the minutia. 
Worth noting that a vendor team dedicated to the work (design, writing code, etc.) is able to build a product faster than one designer, one developer, etc. on the government side who is committed just part time?  That is, gov doesn’t need to in-house a full dev team full time, they just need the skills available part time for review?

Greg: Speaking from the tech lead perspective, I rely a lot on regular communications and code reviews.  I see every line of code that the vendor is delivering before we accept it, before it becomes part of the product.  At first it’s about building trust, but after a while, it’s almost like being a part of the development team - I can be an extra set of eyes just watching out for the kids of goofball mistakes that all of us programmers make sometimes.  The regular communication keeps me informed of issues the vendor is running into, so I can try to help clear those out of the way so they can stay focused.

Rebecca: What do you do when a vendor or a vendor team member isn’t performing well?

Greg:

Michelle: 
This is a hard question. I think the best way to approach this is to not let things get too far along. Open communication. If the vendor isn’t performing, that needs to be discussed during retro. We are in constant communication with our vendors and our agency partners. If our product owner is not satisfied, the vendor knows what changes to make and does it.  Another crucial item to keep in mind is in creating a feedback loop. The vendor shouldn’t be off in their own space working on their own without soliciting feedback from the product owner or users. 
This is where being agile helps out.  It builds feedback loops into the process and, in most agile workflows, there are natural stop-and-review points where it would make sense to let a vendor go if it’s not working out.

Michelle: What kind of deliverables do you require? (i.e. why you actually just really need code) 

Greg
Research document frequently 
Code reviews 
508 compliance 
Code must be stored in an open source repository 

Greg: How have you managed expectations in terms of project delays or potential risks? How has the client handled this?

Rebecca: 
 
FS - vendor didn’t have a user to test the module that was developed, reassuring the vendor that it is govt issue and external risk but not the vendors fault. Trusting the vendor and the govt have a solid relationship 
DOL - code testing - in order to meet the contract requirements they had to remove some of the backlog requirements to write tests 
PWS user stories approach, we are making assumptions of the capacity of work without understanding velocity 
Eqip - haven’t been any delays. No such thing as a greenfield project. Needs to be integrated into a thing that exists. Huge challenge when there are competing priorities.
